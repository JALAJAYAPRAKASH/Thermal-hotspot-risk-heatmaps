This project focuses on preventing power line failures using **AI-driven thermal image analysis.** Overhead transmission cables naturally generate heat due to electrical resistance, but **localized overheating** indicates rising resistance, material degradation, or imminent failure. Manual inspection of long-distance power networks is slow, risky, and inefficient — making early fault detection extremely challenging.

The solution integrates **drones equipped with thermal cameras** to capture infrared imagery of transmission lines. These reveal heat signatures, where:

Normal cables show stable, uniform thermal patterns

Fault-prone cables display abnormal hotspots indicating stress or damage risk

A machine learning classification model is trained to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy cable segments using thermal features. Once deployed, the system automatically analyzes incoming drone data and flags segments whose heat signatures match **pre-failure patterns.**

The output is a **predictive maintenance alert** system that enables crews to repair vulnerable sections before breakdown occurs, reducing:

Power outages

Infrastructure damage

Inspection costs

Safety risks

The project demonstrates how **AI + drones + thermal sensing** can transform traditional power infrastructure maintenance from **reactive repair to proactive intelligence-driven prevention.**
