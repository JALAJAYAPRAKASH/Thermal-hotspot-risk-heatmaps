**AI-Based Thermal Powerline Hotspot Detection**

This project develops an AI-driven predictive maintenance system that detects thermal hotspots in power lines and transmission towers using feature-level thermal data derived from drone inspections.
Instead of raw image processing, the system works on engineered thermal features representing spatial tiles along electrical corridors, enabling scalable and real-time infrastructure intelligence.

**Objectives**

Understand key thermal indicators used in power infrastructure monitoring
Build a machine learning classification model to detect anomalies
Evaluate model reliability beyond accuracy
Perform spatial risk aggregation for corridor-level prioritization
Translate AI outputs into drone inspection & maintenance actions


**Tech Stack**

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Geospatial visualization tools
